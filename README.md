# Blue Book for Bulldozers

Predict the auction sale price for a piece of heavy equipment to create a "blue book" for bulldozers.

I participated in the Blue Book for Bulldozers contest, a classic Kaggle contest. The goal of the contest is to **predict the selling price of bulldozers** at auction based on the use of a specific piece of equipment, equipment type and configuration. The evaluation criterion is the **RMSLE (log error)** between actual and predicted auction prices.
